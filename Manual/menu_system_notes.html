<H1>Introduction to the Menu System (Experimental!)</H1>

<P>The system had a simple, VT100 like, terminal (terminal.js).  menuSystem.js is an, extramly primative, 'web browser' that displays pages on the terminal..</P>

<P>The menus are defined as a, much simplified, HTML pages. This is at an early stage of development. If you think you can improve it feel free to do so. However please re-test/update existing menus so they still work.</P>

<P>Each page consists of a static HTML 'document'. These can be either inline or imported from a separte file.</P>

<P>Menus are handled as a 'stack'. It is possible to go 'back' to previously veiwed menus.</P>

<H2>Why???</H2>
<P>Well 1st because it's fun.</P>
<P>2nd eventually the game may be ported to non-keyboard device. So, whtever the menu system looks like, the interface needs to be accessible via just the flight contols (whatever they are on each system). 
i.e must be driven by 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down' and 'select' ... NOT a mouse or other system dependant UI. </P>

<H2>Structure</H2>

<P>Try to base new menus on the existing ones. Correct implementation of escape sequences can be complex.</P>
<P>Each menu doc contains something like the following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>An outer &ltBODY&gt tag.</LI>
	<LI>A number of &ltP&gt tags:  
		<UL>
			<LI>These contain descriptive text.</LI>
			<LI>May contain standasd '\t', '\n' and '\c' control characters.</LI>
			<LI>ToDo ... Text boxes containing dynamically generated output.</LI>
		</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI>A single &ltUL&gt tag. This contains the selectable menu elements that can interact with the user. Each menu item is defined by a &ltLI&gt tag. This may contain:
		<UL>
			<LI>Just text</LI>
			<LI>An &ltA&gt tag with another menu name (eventually file name) as it's HREF. This opens/pushes a sub menu.</LI>
			<LI>Nothing. This will lead to the default 'back' and 'exit' items being displayed.</LI>
			<LI>ToDo ... Text boxes and buttons.</LI>
			<LI>ToDo ... Multiple entries on each line with 'left' and 'right' selection.</LI>
		</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI>'script' tags. These invoke methods on the 'local' (not 'remote' like real HTML) machine that generate dynaamic pages.</LI>
</UL>

<P>All text can have the following attibutes.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>HIGHLIGHT - Display in reverse video.</LI>
	<LI>CENTER - Center on the screen. May not work if text contains control characters.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Default 'Back' and 'Exit' items are automatically added to every menu.</P>
</BODY>
</HTML>
