	<H2>Staions</H2>
	<P>Stations are reprented as the classic '2001 donut' with a central docking bay.</P>
	<P>By convention stations are located near to the positional origin (point 0,0,0).</P>
	<P>They are immobile and indestructable.</P>
	<P>These are where you:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Get afordable ship repairs.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Eventually will also be able to:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Sell minerals.</LI>
		<LI>Buy/sell trade goods.</LI>
		<LI>Buy additional ship components.</LI>
	</UL>
	<H2>Docking.</H2>
	<P>For now is quite simple. Just line up on the bay (marked with a cross) and fly in at less than 10 m/s.</P>
	<P>If you hit any other part of the station will collide as normal.</P>
	<P>At present docking is quite 'generous' only the centre point of the ship had to be in the bay.</P>
	<H2>Un-docking</H2>
	<P>To launch select 'undock' from the menu. The ship will be undocked and positioned just outside the docking bay.</P>
