	<H2>Ship Components</H2>
	<P>The ship is made up of a number of 'component sets'. Each has a number of 'slots' which can contain a specific 'type' of component.</P>
	<P>For now there is only one slot of each type.</P> 
	<P>Components can be bought and sold as described on the <A HREF="./maintenance.html">'Ship Maintenance'.</A>page.</P>
	<P>Component types are:</P>

	<H3>Hulls</H3>
	<P>If the hull's status drops to 0% the ship is destroyed and it's GAME OVER.</P>
	<P>Maximum speed is dependant on hull status. If pushed any harder ship would shake itself apart.</P>
	<P>The hull also contains a 'template' defining the ship's other initial components.</P>

	<H3>Engines</H3>
	<P>Engines produce 'thrust'.</P>
	<P>The amount of thrust is dependent on the engine's status.</P>
	<P>The ship's acceleration is dependant on the amount of thrust and the ship's mass.</P>
	<P>Deceleration is handled by the engines thrusting in the reverse of the current speed.</P>
	
	<H3>Weapons</H3>
	<P>Weapons may malfunction if status is < 50%.</P>
	
	<H3>Cargo bays</H3>
	<P>Each cargo bay has a maximum capacity. The capacity is reduced if the bay is damaged..</P>
	<H4>Dumping cargo</H4>
	<UL>
	<LI>If capacity is reduced below the curent cargo load the least valuable cargo will be dumped.</LI>
	<LI>If the bay is full and a more valuable cargo is loaded the less valuable is dumped.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>If you have a problem with this policy debate it with the Wookie who does cargo management.</P>

	<H3>Avionics</H3>
	<P>All the electronic bits of the ship (Radar, compass, computers etc.).</P>
	<P>Only one instance of radar or compass may be mounted. However you can carry a spare, in cargo, and swap out the mounted component if it becomed unservicable.</P>

	<H2>Component displays</H2>
	<P>In 'pilot' <A HREF="./controls.html"> camera mode</A> status displays for compnents are shown at the bottom of the screen.</P>
	<P>This can cause a bit of clutter. So initially only the most useful components are shown.</P>
	<P>Additional component displays can be added via the 'Display on/off' buttons in the "Ship Components/Upgrades" menu.</P>
