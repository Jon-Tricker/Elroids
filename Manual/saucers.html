	<H2>Saucers</H2>
	<P>There are several types of saucer. They have differing behaviour, colours and sizes. In 'safe' mode some are less agressive.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>'Mothership' (light green):
			<UL>
				<LI>A single, large, 'Mothership' is created.</LI>
				<LI>Periodically it spawns other saucers.</LI>
				<LI>It will try to avoid you.</LI>
				<LI>The first Mothership, and all it's spawn, are created in 'safe mode'. This gived beginers a chance of learning to fly without too much opposition.</LI>
				<LI>If destroyed a random time latter a replacement is generated. This is in 'normal mode'.</LI>
				<LI>Score a large numer of points. So worth hunting.</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>'Static' (light green). Doesn't move.</LI>
		<LI>'Wanderer' (light blue). Wanders about aimlessly.</LI> 
		<UL>
			<LI>Aren't too dangerous and they block up the 'maximum number of saucers' 'slots'.</LI>
		</UL>
		<LI>'Shooter' (pink):
			<UL> 
				<LI>Moves to a loation near the ship.</LI>
				<LI>Fires missiles in random directions.</LI>
				<LI>Occasionally re-locates.</LI>
				<LI>Occasionally explodes for no good reason.</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>'Hunter' (dark green). Like a 'Shooter' but fires bursts of targeted missiles.</LI>
		<LI>'Rammer' (red):
			<UL>
				<LI>Tries to collide with ship.</LI>
				<LI>Best countered by... 
					<UL>
						<LI>Fly past it at high speed.</LI>
						<LI>Turn 180 degrees</LI>
						<LI>It will now be in your sights and trying to catch up.</LI>
						<LI>Slow down and when it gets close enough kill it.</LI>
					</UL>
			</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>'Pirate' (dark blue (difficult to see ... it's deliberate!)):
			<UL>
				<LI>Steals Minerals and runs away.</LI>
				<LI>Gradually consumes the Minerals it has stolen.</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Todo: Make above list into a table including colours and loot values.</P>
	<P>Saucer pilots aren't great 'navigators'. Even in 'safe' mode they occasionally collide with things.</P>
	<P>All types tend to 'wobble about' while 'seeking' their target location. Makes them difficult to hit. Probably held up with bits of string ... just like 'real' saucers.</P>

	<H2>Loot</H2>
	<P>When a saucer is destroyed it sometimes leaves "loot" <A HREF="./goods.html">("Goods" or "Minerals")</A> behind. The value of the loot is dependant on the type of saucer.</P>
	<P>Loot can be picked up and traded as normal.</P>
	<P>If a saucer is destroyed at long range the loot may be difficult to see. But it is visible on <A HREF="./radar.html">radar</A>.</P>
	<P>Due to their wide travels saucers carry random loot. There may be items that are exotic for the current system.</P>
