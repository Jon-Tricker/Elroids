	<H2>Radar</H2>
	<P>In 'Pilot' mode a 'radar' is provided in the lower centre of the display.</P>
	<P>The radar is a 2D representation an inclined plane 'horizontal' to the ship. The ship is shown by the central white blob. It's forward arc is towards the top of the screen</P>
	<P>Once withing range other objects are diplayed as 'flags'.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>If an object is above the horizontal plane it has a 'stick' downwards to its projected location on the plane.</LI>
		<LI>If an object is below the horizontal plane it has a 'stick' upwards to its projected location on the plane.</LI>
		<LI>Flags have similar colour to the object they represent.</LI>
	</UL>	
	<P>This takes a while to get used to but hopefully is familiar to 'Elite' players.</P>
	<P>Radar 'perspective' implementation is not geometrically correct ... however because forward, most important, arc is not 'shrunk' it's more useful like this.</P>
	<P>ToDo ... add a much better description with diagrams.</P>

	<H2>Compass</H2>
	<P>A 'compass' is displayed in the top right of the radar. It indicates the direction to the closest station and wormhole items in the current system.</P>
	<P>A 'dot' indicates the item's direction. White/cyan for the forward arc. Red/yellow for the rear arc.</P>
	<P>Closer items show larger dots.</P>
	<P>To find the item:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Stop.</LI>
		<LI>Yaw/climb/dive until the dot turns white/cyan.</LI>
		<LI>Yaw/climb/dive until dot in in the centre of the compass.</LI>
		<LI>Item should now be directly ahead. Accelerate towards it.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Note : Sometimes the compass 'flips'. This is when you move through the 'wrap round point' relative to the item. So the direction of the shortest path changes. </P>
