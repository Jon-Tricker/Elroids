	<H2>Credits</H2>
	<P>These are the 'money' of the universe. They are earned for:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Shooting  <A HREF="./saucers.html">saucers</A> (bounty).</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="./trade.html">Trading.</A> <A HREF="./goods.html">"Goods" and "Minerals"</A> at <A HREF="./stations.html">stations.</A></LI>
	</UL>
	<P>They can be spent on ship repairs and upgrades.</P>

	<H2>Score</H2>
	<P>This is an integral of the number of Credits earned during a game.</P>
	
	<H2>Hints</H2>
	<UL>
		<LI>Getting killed early on? ... The initial mothership is created in 'safe' (low leathality) mode. If it is killed replacements are in 'standard' mode. Practice flying, and rock breaking, before killing the initial mothership.</LI>
		<LI>Missiles going in 'odd' directions? They are launched relative to the ships current speed. You may be drifting sideways. Use '?' to stop the ship before fireing.</LI>
		<LI>Sometimes rocks don't break. I think this is generally because they are big rocks that are out of range (the universe is a REALLY big place) get closer.</LI>
		<LI>How to get close to a rock:</LI>
		<OL>
			<LI>Observe direction of rock's movement.</LI>
			<LI>Aim cross hairs slightly ahead of rock's trajectory.</LI>
			<LI>Acceletate. This will move you closer to the rocks trajectory.</LI>
			<LI>When you get close use '?' to stop.</LI>
			<LI>Repeat above.</LI>
		</OL>
		<LI>Minerals can be shot. When firing at large rocks hold down the fire button. When shooting at small rocks fire single shots or you may destroy the products.</LI>
	</UL>

	<H2>Scenery</H2>
	<P>There are a few things you cant interact with. They are useful for orirntation:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>The Sun. A sphere in the location that most of the light is coming from.</LI>
		<LI>Moons. Spheres for orientation. They display 'phase' accurate relative to the sun. There are several colours:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Gray. Standard.</LI>
			<LI>Pink. All hail 'the Lunar Empire'. (Runequest players will understand).</LI>
			<LI>Custard. Beware the custard moon!</LI>
			<LI>Blue. Not often seen.</LI>
			<li>'That's no moon' ... possibly in an expansion.</li>
