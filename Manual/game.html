	<H2>Credits</H2>
	<P>These are the 'money' of the universe. They are earned through <A HREF="./trade.html">Trading.</A> i.e. Selling <A HREF="./goods.html">"Goods" and "Minerals"</A> at <A HREF="./stations.html">stations</A>.</P>
	<P>They can be spent on ship repairs and upgrades.</P>

	<H2>Score</H2>
	<P>This is an integral of the number of Credits earned during a game.</P>
	
	<H2>Hints</H2>
	<UL>
		<LI>Getting killed early on? ... The game is started in 'safe' (low leathality) mode. If you destroy any saucers/ships it switches to 'standard' mode. 
			Practice flying, and rock breaking, before killing anything.</LI>
		<LI>Missiles going in 'odd' directions? They are launched relative to the ships current speed. You may be drifting sideways. Use '?' to stop the ship before fireing.</LI>
		<LI>Sometimes rocks don't break. I think this is generally because they are big rocks that are out of range (the universe is a REALLY big place) get closer.</LI>
		<LI>How to get close to a rock:</LI>
		<OL>
			<LI>Observe direction of rock's movement.</LI>
			<LI>Aim cross hairs slightly ahead of rock's trajectory.</LI>
			<LI>Acceletate. This will move you closer to the rocks trajectory.</LI>
			<LI>When you get close use '?' to stop.</LI>
			<LI>Repeat above.</LI>
		</OL>
		<LI>Minerals can be shot. When firing at large rocks hold down the fire button. When shooting at small rocks fire single shots or you may destroy the products.</LI>
	</UL>

	<H2>Scenery</H2>
	<P>There are a few things you cant interact with. They are useful for orirntation:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>The Sun. A sphere in the location that most of the light is coming from.</LI>
		<LI>Moons. Spheres for orientation. They display 'phase' accurate relative to the sun. There are several colours:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Gray. Standard.</LI>
			<LI>Pink. All hail 'the Lunar Empire'. (Runequest players will understand).</LI>
			<LI>Custard. Beware the custard moon!</LI>
			<LI>Blue. Not often seen.</LI>
			<li>'That's no moon' ... possibly in an expansion.</li>
