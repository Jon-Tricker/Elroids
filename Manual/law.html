	<H2>Guide to law levels.</H2>
	<P>Each system has a law level with 1 being the lowest. Although this is a simplification (and the examples are subjective) law levels roughly correspond to:
		<UL>
			<LI>1 - Lawless (Frontier or war zone).</LI>
			<LI>2 - Minimal (The Wild West).</LI>
			<LI>3 - Low (1920s Chicago, Victorian London).</LI>
			<LI>4 - Medium (Modern day USA).</LI>
			<LI>5 - Regulated (Modern day Europe).</LI>
			<LI>6 - Highly regulated (Modern day China).</LI>
			<LI>7 - Authoritarian (Big Brother is watching you.)</LI>
		</UL>

	<P>Some goods have a 'law level' they are only 'legal' in systems with a lower or equal level</P>
	<P>In most systems it is acceptable to carry illegal goods. However You can try selling them but there may be a penalty.</P>
	<P>Eventually the player may also have an individual 'law level' (influenced by their actions). They may not be welcome in systems with a higher level.</P>
