	<H2>Ship internals</H2>
	<P>The ship is made up of a number of <A HREF="./components.html">'components'</A> (Engines, weapons etc.)</P>
	<P>Each component starts with a number of 'hit points' indicating how tough it is. It also has a 'status' indicating the percentage of these hit points that remain.</P>
	<P>This does mean that, technically, a compoent can have a non integer (maxHP * status) number of hit points.</P>

	<H2>Taking damage</H2>
	<P>When the ship is damaged it is distributed randomly between the ships components. Their 'status' (percentage) is reduced.</P>
	<P>For details of how status loss effects each component type see <A HREF="./components.html"> 'components'</A> page.</P>

	<H2>Repairing damage</H2>
	<P>Damaged components can be repaired via the 'Ship Component Menu'. </P>
	<P>There is a cost, in credits, dependand on the components original cost and how much damage needs to be repaired.</P>
	<P>There is only so much that can be patched up, in flight, with glue and baling twine! If the ship is not docked at a <A HREF="./stations.html">station:</A></P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Repair costs are doubled.</LI>
		<LI>It is not possible to repair above 50%.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Damage for a class of components can be repaired either 10% at a time or the maximum possible can be done in one go.</P>
	<P>If you do not have enough credits damage will only be partially repaired.</P>
	<P>Stations cannot repair components beyond their own tech level ... Patch it in flight and go somewhere that knows how it works.</P>
