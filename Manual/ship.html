	<H2>Ship internals</H2>
	<P>The ship is made up of a number of 'components' (Engines, weapons etc.)</P>
	<P>Each component starts with a number of 'hit points' indicating how tough it is. It also has a 'status' indicating the percentage of these hit points that remain.</P>
	<P>This does mean that, technically, a compoent can have a non integer (maxHP * status) number of hit points.</P>

	<H2>Taking damage</H2>
	<P>When the ship is damaged the damage distributed randomly between it's components. Their 'status' percentage is reduced.</P>
	<P>Some components loose performance as status decreases.</P>
	<P>Others, e.g. weapons, may malfunction if status is < 50%.</P>
	<P>If the hull's status drops to 0% the ship is destroyed and it's GAME OVER.</P>

	<H2>Speed</H2> 
	<P>Acceleration is dependant on engine status.</P>
	<P>Maximum speed is dependant on hull status. If pushed any harder ship would shake itself apart.</P>

	<H2>Repairing damage</H2>
	<P>Damage can be repaired via the menu system. There is a cost, in credits, for this dependand on the components original cost and how much damage needs to be repaired.</P>
	<P>Damage for a class of components can be repaired either 10% at a time or all in on go.</P>
	<P>If you do not have enough credits the damage will only be partially repaired.</P>
