	<H2>Goods and Minerals.</H2>
	<P>There are 3 types of item that can be traded:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Minerals - Obtained by breaking up <A HREF="./rocks.html">'rocks'</A>.</LI>
		<LI>Trade Goods - Various products that can be traded. Each "Goods" object contains a variable number of object. If the goods are damaged some of the objects are destroyed.</LI>
		<LI>Ship components - A sub class of 'Trade Goods' containing individual ship components. Each object contains a single component which may be in a damaged state.</LI>
	</UL>	
	
	<H2>Free floating Goods and Minerals</H2>
	<P>Goods and Minerals can end up floating in space:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Minerals - Are represented as metalic cylinders. Colour indicates the mineral type.</LI>
		<LI>Trade Goods/Ship Components - Are represented bs brown, rectangular 'crates'. Who knows what's in it? ... until you get it on board.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Floating objects can be picked up by ramming them.</P>
	<P>Floating objects a limited lifetime. If not picked up (or destroyed) they self-destruct.</P>

	<H2>Dumping cargo</H2>
	<P>If NOT docked goods/minerals can be 'dumped'. This will leave them floating in space. </P>
	<P>This is useful if you end up carrying illegal goods or want to clear out space in the bay. You can't 'dump' in dock ... it would make a mess on the floor!</P>
