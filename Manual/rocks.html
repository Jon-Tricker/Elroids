	<H2>Rocks</H2>
	<P>Come in various sizes. When hit they split into two parts. If the parts get too small they turn into 'Minerals' (or vanish if contaning nothing of value).</P>
	<P>Rocks have individual 'mineral composition'. The effects their apperance.</P>
	<P>When a rock splits it's components are not divided equally. They 'concentrate' in the remaining parts. Enables the creation of pure 'Minerals' for mining.</P>
	<P>Regardless of composition the radar displays all rocks as dark grey.</P>

	<H2>Minerals</H2>
	<P>Once a rock gets small enough it breaks into 'Minerals', dependant on it's composition, repesented by metalic cylinders.</P>
	<P>Minerals can be picked up by ramming them.</P>
	<P>For now a score/credits are awarded for picking up Minerals. Eventually they will go into the ship's cargo bay and have to be traded for other stuff.</P>
	<P>Minerals have a limited lifetime. If not picked up (or destroyed) they self-destruct.</P>
