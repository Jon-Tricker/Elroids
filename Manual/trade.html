	<H2>Guide to trade.</H2>
	<P>It is possible to trade minerals and ship components.</P>
	<P>Each system has a unique 'technology level','magic level','law level' and 'abundance of minerals'. These effects the value of things when trading </P>

	<H2>Trading minerals</H2>
	<P>Minerals are obtaind by breaking up <A HREF="./rocks.html">'rocks'</A> and picking up the 'Minerals' they release.</P>
	<P>Minerals can be sold, using the 'Cargo Menu', when docked at a <A HREF="./stations.html">station</A>.</P>
	<P>The selling price is dependant on the base price of the mineral and it's abundance in the selling system (rare minerals command higher prices).</P>
	<P>It is thus a good idea to mine in a system where a mineral is common and then sell in one where it's scarce.</P>

	<H2>Trading ship components</H2>
	<P>Components can be bought, when docked at a station, using the 'Purchase Menu'. They can either be:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Bought - Put into the cargo bay for future mounting/sale.</LI>
		<LI>Mounted - Installed into the ship (if there is a free slot for the component).</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Components can later be sold using the 'Cargo Menu'.</P>
	<P>Components can only be bought in systems with a high enough 'Tech Level' to manufacture them.</P>
	<P>Component sale values are higher systems that lack the 'Tech Level' necessary to maufacture the component.</P>
