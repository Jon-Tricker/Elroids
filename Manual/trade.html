	<H2>Guide to trade.</H2>
	<P>When docked at a <A HREF="./stations.html">station</A> It is possible to trade <A HREF="./goods.html">'Minerals and "Goods"</A>. This is done using:
		<UL>
			<LI>The 'Cargo Menu' to sell things.</LI>
			<LI>The 'Component and Goods Purchase Menus to buy things.</LI>
		</UL>
	</P>
	<P>Each system has a unique 'technology level','magic level','law level' and 'abundance of minerals'.</P>

	<H2>Trading minerals</H2>
	<P>The selling price is dependant on the base price of the mineral and it's abundance in the selling system (rare minerals command higher prices).</P>
	<P>It is thus a good idea to mine in a system where a mineral is common and then sell in one where it's scarce.</P>

	<H2>Trading goods</H2>
	<P>Each type of goods has two 'prices':</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>'Cost' - This is a indication of the basic value of the goods.</LI>
		<LI>'Value' (in system) - This is the price at which the goods are trading in the current system. This may be adjusted dependant on the systems technology on magic levels. Generally things that cannot be produced locally have higher value.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>Goods can only be bought in systems with a high enough 'Tech/Magic Level' to manufacture them.</P>
	<P>Goods sale values are higher systems that lack the 'Tech/Magic Level' necessary to maufacture the component.</P>
	<P>Goods are legal up to a certain law level.</P>
	<P>In most systems it is acceptable to carry illegal goods. However You can try selling them but there may be a penalty.</P>

	<H2>Trading ship components</H2>
	<P>In addition to 'buying' components, into the bay, they can also be 'Mounted' i.e. installed directly into the ship.</P>
	<P>'Hulls' are a little different. The ship only has a single hull. It can be 'upgraded' via the 'Purchase Menu'.</P>
