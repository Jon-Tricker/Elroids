	<H2>Source access</H2>
	<P>There is a, currently private, github repository <A HREF="https://github.com/Jon-Tricker/Elroids">here</A>. </P>
	<P>Alternatly it's all just script. You can 'inspect'/download the code from your browser.</P>
	<P>There is also a facebook discussion group <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1134918534166826">here</A>. If
		you want github access please join this and post a request to be added.</P>

	<H2>Known bugs</H2>
	<UL>
		<LI>Missiles are created too far in front of ship (see 'quantization' issue below). Sometimes miss very close
			targets ... fix</LI>
		<LI>Sometimes control keys seem to get stuck (keyboard.js) ... Think this is when the debugger is used and it
			consumes some of the event..</LI>
		<LI>First key click gets ignored.</LI>
		<LI>If going fast enough can fly through station. Hit it but get kicked out the far side.</LI>
		<LI>Menu system/cursors only just works. Requies carefully 'tuned' menu pages.</LI>
		<LI>Labels are in the foreground. If something passes between the viewer and a labeled object label will be infront.</LI>

	<H3>General 'good stuff' ... Post V6.0</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>Game mechanics:
			<UL>
				<LI>Improve 'vision through' wrap to take account of camera direction (i.e. dont just use
					Universe.handleWrap()). i.e. allow rocks to be seen at full universe width not half.</LI>
				<LI>Improve 'collision detection' mechanism (Item.detectCollision()). Although, for now, the 'cylinder
					Vs sphere' bounding check seems to be doing good service.</LI>
					<UL>
						<LI>For ship/station interaction, once an rough aproximation to a collision is detected, it is confirmed using ray tracing (Item.isPointInside()). Maybe extend to ray trace all the corners of the Items bounding box.</LI>
						<LI>Carve the universe into 'regions'. So don't have the square law issue of checking collisions
							between everything and 'everthing else'.</LI>
					</UL>
				</LI>
				<LI>Limited number of missiles in flight (like Asteroids).</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI>Do something about saucer 'seeking' target location behaviour ... or maybe just leave it since it looks like
			defensive manouvering.</LI>
		<LI>Componentize sacucer</LI>
		<LI>Sort out menu system:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Current code for buttons and scripts is ugly. Works in the context of MenuSystem, where it is evaled,
				rather than it's own. Good enough for a 'minimum feature set' but needs a re-work.</LI>
			<LI>Currently buttons won't work on nested tables</LI>
			<LI>Re-work menu system as real HTML with style sheets to control look and feel. Back end to communicating
				via HTTP with a, localy implemeneted in the client, 'HTML server'. </LI>
		</UL>
		<LI>Add 'crafting' ship components/trade goods out of minerals.</LI>
		<LI>Try it with really big rocks.</LI>
		</LI>

		<LI>Code:</LI>
		<LI>Prettiness:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Give different hull types differing physical apperance.</LI>
			<LI>Create 'exploding ship' animation. (Exploding Mesh? Then it could also do rocks/saucers etc.)</LI>
			<LI>Add surface texture to ship.</LI>
			<LI>Make saucers more 'shiny'. Probably involves MeshPhongMaterial ... but for me that just comes out white.
			</LI>
			<LI>Add extra vt100 features (e.g. block graphics) to ship control terminal.</LI>
			<LI>Fix audio to use THREE.PositionalAudio (Item.js.playSound()). I tried but cant get the listener to stay
				stuck to the camera in all cases. Maybe add it to the Ship instead. Fell back on manually reducing volume
				wih distance (and living without correct stereo).</LI>
			<LI>Make crater and galaxy textures proceduraly generated (less download).</LI>
			<LI>Add 'tunnel' graphics when going through wormholes.</LI>
		</UL>

		<LI>Additional features:
			<UL>
				<LI>Implement mother ships spawning more mother ships?</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>

		<LI>UI improvements:
		<LI>Abstract keyboard controls to Events (Roll left, Pause, etc.) rather than characters. Makes switch to other
			UIs easier.</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Add mouse controls.</LI>
			<LI>Make radar zoomable.</LI>
			<LI>Add joystick/tablet controls (maybe via on screen buttons reproducing keyboard keys). Maybe use tilt sensor for movement.</LI>
		</UL>
		</LI>

		<LI>Extensions:
			<UL>
				<LI>Test on platforms other than PC/Chrome</LI>
				<LI>Make it multi-player (AJAX?).</LI>
				<LI>Add optional gravity effects (like Gravitar).</LI>
				<LI>Add on line high score table?</LI>
				<LI>Add save/load ... not sure how on a web based game.</LI>
				<LI>Maybe collision damage should be proportional to mass and relative speed of colliding object. Common
					for all items apart from 'rock on rock' impacts.</LI>
				<LI>Make parts lists at station a genuine list (variable availability and costs) rather than a 'catalog'.</LI>
				<LI>Revisit inline 'ToDos'.</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>

	<H2>Learnings</H2>
	<UL>
		<LI>Three JS is oriented towards 'landscape' scenes.
			odd things (flipings and unexpected rotations)
			can happen if a camera flies over the 'poles'.
			After a lot of effort I worked round this by making the 'chase/pilot
			cameras' part of the ship.
		</LI>
		<LI>Two threejs 'renderers' are used:
		<UL>
			<LI>A THREE.WebGLRenderer handles the 3D rendering.</LI>
			<LI>A separate CSS2DRenderer handles 2D objects, like labels, that we want to be flat on to camera.</LI>
		</UL>
			This as described in the exapmle <A HREF="https://threejs.org/examples/css2d_label.html"> here.</A>
		</LI>

		<LI>1D conservation of momentum, during collisions, is handled as described in the equasions
			<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"> here.</A>
			Most discussion on extending this to 3D decends into a mass of 'Euler angles' and 'trig'. However since we
			have both the
			velocities and impact direction as x, y and z components it can be handled using
			dot products (and less CPU) ... but it took a while to get the maths right.
		</LI>
		<LI>There are problems with 'quantized' time. A slower moving object can catch up with and collide with a faster
			one if it gets a move phase 'first'. Some messy work round have been required.</LI>
		<LI>Sound support on Chrome is a pain. In an attempt to block audio spam audio components can only ne
			initialized from within user events. So sounds have to be loaded on the first key/mouse click. Which means
			they are not yet ready if this event wans to make a sound,</LI>
		<LI>'statics' are slow. Require an instance of the class to be created? For better performance create a single instance as part of a top level object (e.g. Game) and call by reference.</LI>
	</UL>

	<H2>Units and dimensions</H2>
	<P>This project was coded with arbitary units of distance, mass and time. I have since modified it to use something resembling
		SI.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Distance:
			<UL>
				<LI>For short distance (within systems) is in Meters.</LI>
				<LI>For long distance (between systems) is in some larger unit (lightyears?).</LI>
			</UL> 
		</LI>
		<LI>Mass is in Tonnes (1000KG).</LI>
		<LI>Time is in seconds.</LI>
		<LI>Damage (HPs) is an arbitary unit. However, from the 'ram damage' calculation we can conclude that its units are M kg m/s</LI>
		<LI>Rocks have a mass equal to the cube of their size. i.e (assuming cubic rocks) a density of about 1
			tonne/m^3. Probably should be a bit higher and related to their composition. However it will do for now.
		</LI>
	</UL>

	<P>There are a few incorrect 'artifacts' to make the game playable.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Rock mass is proportional to the cube of its size. When a rock splits it make 2 rocks of half the size. So
			3/4 of the mass is lost. However this makes for a mangable amounts of minerals once a rock is broken down.
			(The spare mass becomes 'dark matter')</LI>
		<LI>Universe is too small. Only a few km across. Necessary to keep a reasonable rock density wihtout a huge
			number of rocks.</LI>
		<LI>Distances and sizes are far too small for a 'realistic' universe. However if made realistic objects would
			only be points of light in the distance. For playability everything is moved closer together. (Excuse:
			StarTrek/Wars battles where ships engage a few hundred meters apart and travelling at a few 10s of kph.)
		</LI>
		<LI>At present angular momentum is not conserved (for anything) ... If it were ship contol would be difficult.</LI>
		<LI>Deceleration doesn't really make sense. Engines fire in a ramdom direction. But it is necessary for game play.</LI>
	</UL>

	<H2>Why not Typescript?</H2>
	<P>As a Java coder I prefer stongly typed languages. However...</P>
	<OL>
		<LI>I only found out about Typescript late in the development of this project.</LI>
		<LI>I want the code available warts/comments and all. Not an additional build step with modified output.</LI>
	</OL>
