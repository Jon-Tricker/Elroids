	<H2>Source access</H2>
	<P>There is a, currently private, github repository <A HREF="https://github.com/Jon-Tricker/Elroids">here</A>. </P>
	<P>Alternatly it's all just script. You can 'inspect'/download the code from your browser.</P>
	<P>There is also a facebook discussion group <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1134918534166826">here</A>. If
		you want github access please join this and post a request to be added.</P>

	<H2>Known bugs</H2>
	<UL>
		<LI>Missiles are created too far in front of ship (see 'quantization' issue below). Sometimes miss very close
			targets ... fix</LI>
		<LI>Sometimes control keys seem to get stuck (keyboard.js) ... Think this is when the debugger is used and it
			consumes some of the event..</LI>
		<LI>First key click gets ignored.</LI>
		<LI>If going fast enough can fly through station. Hit it but get kicked out the far side.</LI>
		<LI>Menu system/cursors only just works. Requies carefully 'tuned' menu pages.</LI>
		<LI>Labels are in the foreground. If something passes between the viewer and a labeled object label will be infront.</LI>
	</UL>

	<P>For notes on code operation/stucture see the <A HREF="developer_code_notes.html">Developer Code notes.</A>.</P>

	<H2>ToDos (In some sort of priority order)</H2>

	<H3>V6.x Economics game</H3>
	<P>Create 'Trade/Goods' class. Move Components under it.</P>

	<H3>V7.x Implement local load/save</H3>

	<H3>V8.x Add extra ship components.</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>'Elite style' (over heating) beam weapon.</LI>
		<LI>Thrusters (directional control)</LI>
		<LI>Electronics ... including:
		<UL>
			<LI>radar</LI>
			<LI>HUD</LI>
			<LI>Docking computer. Then make docking more difficult.</LI>
			<LI>Range finder</LI>
			<LI>Mineral detector</LI>
			<LI>Missile lock.</LI>
		</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>Homing missile</LI>
		<LI>Proximity missiles (mainly for use by the bad guys).</LI>
		<LI>Shields.</LI>
		<LI>Separate warp drive.</LI>
		<LI>Improved terminal (but keep VT100 as default).</LI>
	</UL>

	<H3>V9.x Design better opposition.</H3>

	<H3>V10.0 Extend economy.</H3>
	<P>Add non mineral trade goods (requires multiple systems/stations.)</P>

	<H3>Documentation.</H3>
	<P>Add screen shot with various display panels labled.</P>
	<P>Add images (screen shots) of Items in place of game logo.</P>

	<H3>General 'good stuff' ... Post V6.0</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>Game mechanics:
			<UL>
				<LI>Improve 'vision through' wrap to take account of camera direction (i.e. dont just use
					Universe.handleWrap()). i.e. allow rocks to be seen at full universe width not half.</LI>
				<LI>Improve 'collision detection' mechanism (Item.detectCollision()). Although, for now, the 'cylinder
					Vs sphere' bounding check seems to be doing good service.</LI>
					<UL>
						<LI>For ship/station interaction, once an rough aproximation to a collision is detected, it is confirmed using ray tracing (Item.isPointInside()). Maybe extend to ray trace all the corners of the Items bounding box.</LI>
						<LI>Carve the universe into 'regions'. So don't have the square law issue of checking collisions
							between everything and 'everthing else'.</LI>
					</UL>
				</LI>
				<LI>Limited number of missiles in flight (like Asteroids).</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI>Do something about saucer 'seeking' target location behaviour ... or maybe just leave it since it looks like
			defensive manouvering.</LI>
		<LI>Componentize sacucer</LI>
		<LI>Sort out menu system:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Current code for buttons and scripts is ugly. Works in the context of MenuSystem, where it is evaled,
				rather than it's own. Good enough for a 'minimum feature set' but needs a re-work.</LI>
			<LI>Currently buttons won't work on nested tables</LI>
			<LI>Re-work menu system as real HTML with style sheets to control look and feel. Back end to communicating
				via HTTP with a, localy implemeneted in the client, 'HTML server'. </LI>
		</UL>
		<LI>Add 'crafting' ship components/trade goods out of minerals.</LI>
		<LI>Try it with really big rocks.</LI>
		</LI>

		<LI>Code:</LI>
		<LI>Prettiness:</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Give different hull types differing physical apperance.</LI>
			<LI>Create 'exploding ship' animation. (Exploding Mesh? Then it could also do rocks/saucers etc.)</LI>
			<LI>Add surface texture to ship.</LI>
			<LI>Make saucers more 'shiny'. Probably involves MeshPhongMaterial ... but for me that just comes out white.
			</LI>
			<LI>Add extra vt100 features (e.g. block graphics) to ship control terminal.</LI>
			<LI>Fix audio to use THREE.PositionalAudio (Item.js.playSound()). I tried but cant get the listener to stay
				stuck to the camera in all cases. Maybe add it to the Ship instead. Fell back on manually reducing volume
				wih distance (and living without correct stereo).</LI>
			<LI>Make crater textures proceduraly generated (less download).</LI>
			<LI>Add 'tunnel' graphics when going through wormholes.</LI>
		</UL>

		<LI>Additional features:
			<UL>
				<LI>Implement mother ships spawning more mother ships?</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>

		<LI>UI improvements:
		<LI>Abstract keyboard controls to Events (Roll left, Pause, etc.) rather than characters. Makes switch to other
			UIs easier.</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Add mouse controls.</LI>
			<LI>Make radar zoomable.</LI>
			<LI>Add joystick/tablet controls (maybe via on screen buttons reproducing keyboard keys). Maybe use tilt sensor for movement.</LI>
		</UL>
		</LI>

		<LI>Extensions:
			<UL>
				<LI>Test on platforms other than PC/Chrome</LI>
				<LI>Make it multi-player (AJAX?).</LI>
				<LI>Add optional gravity effects (like Gravitar).</LI>
				<LI>Add on line high score table?</LI>
				<LI>Maybe collision damage should be proportional to mass and relative speed of colliding object. Common for all items apart from 'rock on rock' impacts.</LI>
				<LI>Revisit inline 'ToDos'.</LI>
			</UL>
		</LI>
